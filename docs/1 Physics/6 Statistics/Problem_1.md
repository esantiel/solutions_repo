### Exploring the Central Limit Theorem Through Simulations

The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a fundamental concept in statistics, asserting that the distribution of sample means approximates a normal distribution as the sample size grows, regardless of the population's underlying distribution. This project uses simulations to demonstrate this phenomenon, offering a hands-on way to visualize and understand the theorem’s power.

#### 1. Simulating Sampling Distributions

We’ll simulate three distinct population distributions:
- **Uniform Distribution**: A flat, evenly distributed range of values.
- **Exponential Distribution**: A skewed, right-tailed distribution common in time-to-event data.
- **Binomial Distribution**: A discrete distribution representing successes in a fixed number of trials.

For each, we’ll generate a large population dataset (e.g., 100,000 values) to serve as the basis for sampling.

#### 2. Sampling and Visualization

For each population:
- Draw random samples of sizes 5, 10, 30, and 50.
- Compute the sample mean for each draw.
- Repeat this process 1,000 times to build a sampling distribution of the means.
- Plot histograms of these sample means to observe their shape and convergence to normality.

#### 3. Parameter Exploration

We’ll examine:
- How the original distribution’s shape (e.g., skewness) affects convergence.
- How sample size impacts the rate at which the sampling distribution becomes normal.
- The role of population variance in determining the spread of the sampling distribution.

#### 4. Practical Applications

The CLT underpins many real-world statistical methods:
- **Estimating Population Parameters**: Confidence intervals rely on the normality of sample means.
- **Quality Control**: Manufacturers use sample means to monitor product consistency.
- **Financial Models**: Stock returns are often modeled assuming normality of aggregated data.

### Results and Observations

#### Plots
Running the code generates three sets of four histograms (one set per distribution), each showing the sampling distribution of the mean for sample sizes 5, 10, 30, and 50.

- **Uniform Distribution**: Even with a small sample size (n=5), the sampling distribution looks somewhat bell-shaped, though with noticeable irregularities. By n=30, it closely resembles a normal distribution, and at n=50, the fit is nearly perfect.
- **Exponential Distribution**: This skewed population starts with a noticeably asymmetric sampling distribution at n=5. As sample size increases, the skewness diminishes, and by n=30 or n=50, the distribution is nearly normal.
- **Binomial Distribution**: As a discrete distribution, the sampling means at n=5 show distinct peaks. With larger samples (n=30 and beyond), the distribution smooths out and approaches normality.

#### Parameter Exploration
- **Shape Influence**: The exponential distribution, being highly skewed, requires a larger sample size (closer to 30) for normality to emerge compared to the symmetric uniform distribution. The binomial distribution’s convergence depends on its parameters (n and p), but with moderate values (n=10, p=0.5), it behaves similarly.
- **Sample Size**: Across all distributions, larger sample sizes accelerate convergence to a normal shape, aligning with CLT expectations.
- **Variance Impact**: The population variance affects the spread of the sampling distribution. The theoretical variance of the sampling distribution is σ²/n, where σ² is the population variance and n is the sample size. For example, the exponential distribution (variance ≈ 4) produces wider sampling distributions than the binomial (variance ≈ 2.5) at the same sample size.

### Discussion and Implications

The simulations vividly illustrate the CLT: regardless of the population’s original shape—flat (uniform), skewed (exponential), or discrete (binomial)—the sampling distribution of the mean becomes normal as sample size increases. This aligns with theoretical expectations and explains why statistical methods like t-tests and confidence intervals, which assume normality, work well with sufficiently large samples.

In practice, the CLT justifies:
- **Estimation**: We can use sample means to estimate population parameters, confident that their distribution is approximately normal for large n.
- **Quality Control**: Manufacturers sample products and rely on the CLT to assess whether mean dimensions meet specifications.
- **Finance**: Aggregated returns or risks often approximate normality, enabling predictive modeling.

The variance exploration highlights a key nuance: while the shape converges to normal, the spread depends on both the population variance and sample size. This reminds us to consider sample size carefully in applications where precision is critical.

This exercise deepens our appreciation for the CLT’s robustness and universality, bridging theory and practice through computational exploration. Feel free to tweak the code—adjust population parameters or sample sizes—to further probe its behavior!
